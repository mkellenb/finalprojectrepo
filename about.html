      <h3>this personality quiz will tell you the kind of coder you are when you are in the coding workspace there are 3 types of personalities you may have</h2>
      <h2>1. Front End</h2>
        <h3>A front end developer has one general responsibility: to ensure that website visitors can easily interact with the page. They do this through the combination of design, technology and programming to code a website's appearance, as well as taking care of debugging.</h3>
        <h2>2. Back End</h2>
        <h3>Back end developers are responsible for creating and maintaining technology at the back end of a website (the server, database and application). The attractive visuals created by designers, UX professionals and front end developers couldn't exist without the technology provided by a back end developer.</h3>
        <h2>3. Full Stack</h2>
        <h3>A Full Stack Developer is someone who works with the Back End — or server side — of the application as well as the Front End, or client side. Full Stack Developers have to have some skills in a wide variety of coding niches, from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management in order to do their job well.</h3>
